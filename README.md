Unstabled Horse Game!

You play as a horse who has recognized what life could be like outside of the stable. Battle the stable in a continuous game that changes to fight for your freedom!

The stable is a fickle being that may change the game you’re playing at any time!

Controls– 

Joust - just press the z button a bunch 

Checkers - Left/Right arrows to change piece, z to select and move, and x to cancel a selected piece 
  — When someone gets a king the stable changes his mind! 

Billiards - arrow keys to choose ball/aim, z or x to select/shoot

The stable isn’t quite smart enough to play billiards, so you may need to grab a friend to play (we ran out of time :) )
